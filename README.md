# Useragent

A nifty tool for quickly generating a plausible useragent, using the library.

In the usual fashion you can `npm update` later if you feel like it.

## Usage

1. Install node in the usual fashion
2. `node useragent.mjs`
3. You can create a script like below to run it elsewhere I guess.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
node $HOME/src/useragent/index.mjs
```
